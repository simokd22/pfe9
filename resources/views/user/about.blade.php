			<h3>Our Collaborative Project</h3>
			<p>As part of our coursework, we worked as a team on a web scraping project using Laravel. Our goal was to collect news articles from Moroccan news websites in French and display them in a central location. We used Laravel's built-in web scraping tools, as well as custom code to clean and parse the data. The final product is a website that aggregates news articles from several sources and displays them in a user-friendly format.</p>
